### 🗣 Introduction

Tatako Gemu is a game where the player assumes the role of a survival of a shipwreck and now needs to find a way out to the nearest safest place. Of course this task won't be easy to do alone, so gather strengh in numbers with other players and find a way out of this scary sea.

But beware, this isn't a normal sea, many danger lurks around, and a sea being may be sneaking behind your group.

So jump between planks. Shoot cannons at sharks. Unleash the anchor. And fight the Kraken! ... Or not.

May the 7 seas bestow their bless upon you.

Uppon reaching the ship again, you find out that the ship has only one escape boat left, and it its on the other side of the ship.

The survivals them decide what they need to do next in order to survive.
